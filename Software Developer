Hello everyone,
I aspire to become a software developer!
This means that I need to be acquanted with multiple programming languages, frameworks, algorithms, and programming concepts.
As requested, I am 22 years old. I actually started coding in my late 20. Wow I've learned so much in just one year and a half.
